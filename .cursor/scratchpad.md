# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities (PRIORITY UPDATE)
Based on the npm audit, we have identified several critical security vulnerabilities that need attention, but will be addressed strategically rather than rushing breaking changes during active development:

1. **High Severity Vulnerabilities (9)**
   - axios (<=0.29.0): CSRF vulnerability and SSRF vulnerability 
   - nth-check (<2.0.1): Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
   - parse-duration (<2.1.3): Regex Denial of Service vulnerability
   - ws (7.0.0 - 7.5.9): DoS vulnerability when handling requests with many HTTP headers

2. **Moderate Severity Vulnerabilities (9)**
   - nanoid (4.0.0 - 5.0.8): Predictable results in nanoid generation
   - postcss (<8.4.31): Line return parsing error

### Security Remediation Strategy (Updated)
We've created a comprehensive security plan (see `security-plan.md`) that takes a strategic approach:

1. **Continue Development with Awareness**
   - Document all known vulnerabilities
   - Update direct dependencies where possible without breaking changes
   - Implement security best practices in new code

2. **Pre-Launch Security Implementation**
   - Schedule comprehensive security remediation 2-4 weeks before launch
   - Implement automated security scanning in CI pipeline
   - Create detailed implementation plans for each breaking change

3. **Post-Launch Security Maintenance**
   - Implement regular security check schedule
   - Create security update process
   - Monitor for new vulnerabilities

This approach allows development to continue smoothly while ensuring security is properly addressed before the application reaches production.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Implement Security Awareness**
   - Complete the security vulnerability inventory
   - Set up automated security scanning in CI pipeline
   - Update direct dependencies that don't require code changes

2. **Complete Search/Blockchain Crawler Integration**

   - Improve content management interface
   - Implement robust tagging system for better organization
   - Streamline movie tokenization process
   - Develop batch operations for efficient catalog management
   - Create detailed analytics dashboard for Pro users

4. **Storage and Content Delivery System**
   - Implement user-powered IPFS node network with incentives
   - Develop progressive decentralization strategy for content delivery
   - Create efficient content streaming solution for decentralized assets

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
### Security Vulnerabilities (New Critical Priority)
We have identified several security vulnerabilities in our dependencies through GitHub security alerts and npm audit. These include:
- High severity vulnerabilities (9): Including issues in axios, nth-check, parse-duration, and ws packages
- Moderate severity vulnerabilities (9): Including issues in nanoid and postcss packages
- Low severity vulnerabilities (2)

We need to address these vulnerabilities immediately before proceeding with further feature development. The vulnerability in axios is particularly concerning as it could potentially allow CSRF and SSRF attacks. We'll need to approach this systematically to avoid breaking changes where possible.

### Platform Progress
// ... existing code ...

## Key Challenges and Analysis
The Pro interface urgently needs enhancements as it's the primary touchpoint for content creators. A more intuitive and visually clear interface will help gain filmmaker trust. This is a critical step before focusing on the marketplace/consumer side.

Achieving platform parity is essential for providing a cohesive user experience across all parts of the platform. Currently, there are inconsistencies between the Pro interface and consumer-facing pages like Search and Store. We need to develop shared components that can be used across the platform to ensure visual and behavioral consistency.

The Pro Analytics Dashboard is a critical feature that will provide content creators with valuable insights into their content performance, audience engagement, and revenue streams. By implementing this feature, we will enhance the value proposition for content creators and help them make data-driven decisions about their content strategy.

A key challenge for our analytics approach is that as an inter-platform protocol, we don't have access to traditional user data. Instead, we need to focus on blockchain-specific metrics like wallet behavior patterns, token distribution, and transaction histories. This privacy-first approach aligns with blockchain principles while still providing valuable insights to content creators.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
We need to determine the best approach to resolve the security vulnerabilities:

1. For non-breaking changes:
   - Can we immediately run `npm audit fix` without breaking functionality?
   - Which vulnerabilities can be fixed without disrupting the application?

2. For breaking changes:
   - What's the estimated effort to fix axios vulnerabilities?
   - Can we isolate the breaking changes to minimize impact?
   - What testing would be required to verify the fixes don't break functionality?

We also need guidance on setting up the IPFS node cluster:
1. How many nodes should we deploy in the cluster?
2. What is the appropriate geographic distribution for nodes to ensure global access?
3. What hardware specifications are required for production nodes?
4. Should we use a managed service or self-host the node cluster?
