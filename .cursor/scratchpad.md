## Wallet Integration & Blockchain Components Research

The codebase already has several components that can be leveraged for wallet integration:

1. **WalletContext.tsx** (~545 lines) - Provides comprehensive wallet management including:
   - Connection handling for MetaMask and WalletConnect
   - Network switching functionality
   - Account change detection
   - Notification system for wallet events

2. **useWallet.ts** hook - Simple hook for accessing wallet context

3. **blockchain.service.ts** (~1350 lines) - Extensive service providing:
   - ERC-1155 token contract integration
   - Marketplace contract integration
   - Token minting, creation, and management
   - Purchase and listing functionality
   - Rights thresholds management (for different license types)
   - MetaMask token import

### Implementation Plan for Next Session

1. **Royalty System Refinement**:
   - Implement configurable royalty rates (5-15%)
   - Start with single recipient model for simplicity
   - Add basic tracking and reporting for royalty payments
   - Defer multi-party distribution to future iterations

2. **Wallet Integration Enhancement**:
   - Refine existing wallet components for production
   - Update token ownership verification
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Ensure consistent UI/UX for wallet interactions

3. **IPFS Integration**:
   - Implement basic upload/retrieval functionality
   - Add content addressing for permanent links
   - Implement file encryption for premium content
   - Set up pinning service integration

## Project Status Board (Updated)

- [x] Implement sample data for development testing

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
1. Need to implement the library frontend components
2. Need to create the analytics dashboard
3. Need to implement the content lending system

## Lessons
1. Always validate user input on both frontend and backend
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Keep authentication and authorization consistent across the application
5. Use middleware for common functionality
6. Document API endpoints and their requirements
7. Test all routes and endpoints thoroughly
