# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

### Token Model Clarification

The Wylloh platform utilizes ERC-1155 tokens in a unique way that's important to understand:

- **NOT Copyright Ownership**: The tokens do NOT represent copyright ownership of the films themselves. Copyright and intellectual property rights remain fully with the studio or creator.

- **Perpetual Access Rights**: Each token represents perpetual access rights to the content, similar to owning a DVD or Blu-ray:
  - Indefinite right to download and watch the film
  - Permanent addition to the user's digital library
  - Non-revocable access (as long as token is held)
  
- **Distribution Rights Through Stacking**: Beyond basic access rights, tokens can be stacked to unlock commercial distribution rights:
  - Streaming rights for specific regions
  - Theatrical distribution rights
  - Other distribution channels
  - Rights level determined by token quantity held
  
- **Embedded Utility**: Each token includes utility features such as:
  - Permanent content access and download rights
  - Distribution permissions (when stacked)
  - Platform features specific to the rights level
  - Commercial licensing capabilities

This model combines the permanence of physical media ownership with the flexibility of digital rights management, while enabling commercial distribution through token stacking.

   - Automatic retry with backoff
   - Dead letter queues
   - Transaction rollback
   - State reconciliation

2. **Monitoring Points**
   - RPC connection status
   - Event subscription health
   - Processing queue length
   - Error rates and types

3. **Analytics Error Handling** âœ…
   - Graceful degradation for missing data
   - Proper error responses for API endpoints
   - Logging of analytics processing errors
   - Fallback to cached data when appropriate

### Data Freshness Strategies

1. **Real-time Updates**
   ```typescript
   interface UpdateStrategy {
     // Connected user updates
     subscribeToUserWallets(userId: string): Promise<void>;
     handleWalletEvent(event: WalletEvent): Promise<void>;
     
     // Global store updates
     subscribeToWyllohContracts(): Promise<void>;
     handleContractEvent(event: ContractEvent): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

2. **Background Sync System**
   ```typescript
   interface BackgroundSync {
     // Periodic full sync
     scheduleFullSync(cronPattern: string): void;
     executeFullSync(): Promise<void>;
     
     // Progressive sync for inactive wallets
     syncInactiveWallets(threshold: number): Promise<void>;
     prioritizeSyncQueue(): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

3. **Sync Scheduling**
   - Active Users (connected within 24h):
     * Real-time WebSocket updates
     * Immediate event processing
     * Transaction confirmation tracking
   
   - Semi-Active Users (1-7 days):
     * Daily full sync
     * Batch event processing
     * Priority in sync queue
   
   - Inactive Users (>7 days):
     * Weekly full sync
     * Background processing
     * Lower priority in queue

4. **Store Consistency**
   - Real-time monitoring of Wylloh contracts
   - Periodic validation of listed items
   - Automatic price and availability updates
   - Market activity tracking

5. **Data Validation**
   ```typescript
   interface DataValidator {
     // Library validation
     validateUserLibrary(userId: string): Promise<ValidationResult>;
     reconcileLibraryState(userId: string): Promise<void>;
     
     // Store validation
     validateStoreContents(): Promise<ValidationResult>;
     reconcileStoreState(): Promise<void>;
     
     // Consistency checks
     checkDataConsistency(): Promise<ConsistencyReport>;
     fixInconsistencies(report: ConsistencyReport): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

6. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Missed event recovery
   - State reconciliation
   - Data repair procedures
   - Conflict resolution

# Platform Philosophy & Token Architecture

## Core Vision
Wylloh aims to accelerate quality storytelling through decentralized technology and aligned incentives. Unlike traditional streaming platforms where success can increase costs and misalign incentives, Wylloh's decentralized architecture becomes more efficient and cost-effective with scale.

### Key Principles
1. **Positive-Sum Technology**:
   - Embrace e/acc movement's optimistic view of technological progress
   - Focus on how technology can enhance creative expression
   - Build systems that become more efficient with scale

2. **Aligned Incentives**:
   - Traditional Streaming: Success â†’ Higher CDN Costs â†’ Incentive for Shallow Engagement
   - Wylloh Model: Success â†’ Stronger Network â†’ Lower Costs â†’ Better Content

3. **Quality Through Decentralization**:
   - Decentralized storage reduces costs while improving reliability
   - Community-driven content validation without gatekeeping
   - Transparent, verifiable quality standards

## Token Architecture

### WyllohCoin (Platform Token)
- **Purpose**: Platform utility and network incentivization
- **Use Cases**:
  * Incentivize IPFS storage network (similar to Filecoin)
  * Purchase movie tokens
  * Platform operations and governance
- **Network Effect**: Strengthens platform infrastructure

### Movie Tokens (Content-Specific)
- **Structure**: Individual ERC-1155 tokens per movie
- **Chain**: Primarily on Polygon for low gas fees
- **Verification**: Implements IWyllohVerified interface
- **Example Structure**:
  * Movie Budget: $10M USD
  * Token Structure: 500K tokens at $20 USD each
  * Quality Assurance: Wylloh verification tag
- **Benefits**:
  * Fractional ownership
  * Standardized quality verification
  * Efficient trading on Polygon
  * Clear provenance through Wylloh verification

## Technical Implementation Focus

1. **Chain Strategy**:
   - Primary: Polygon for movie tokens (low fees, high throughput)
   - Secondary: Ethereum for WyllohCoin (security, stability)
   - Support: BSC for additional liquidity options

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Implement IWyllohVerified interface checks
   - Standardized metadata validation
   - Automated quality verification
   - Single moderator system for initial phase

3. **Network Efficiency**:
   - Decentralized CDN grows stronger with usage
   - Cost efficiency improves with scale
   - Network effects benefit all participants

4. **Monitoring Strategy**:
   - Focus on Polygon for movie token events
   - Monitor WyllohCoin across chains
   - Track network health metrics
   - Validate token authenticity
