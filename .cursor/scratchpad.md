# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities (PRIORITY UPDATE)
Based on the npm audit, we have identified several critical security vulnerabilities that need attention, but will be addressed strategically rather than rushing breaking changes during active development:

1. **High Severity Vulnerabilities (9)**
   - axios (<=0.29.0): Critical vulnerability with limited exploitation risk in our product context
   - cors (<=2.8.5): Reflected cross-site scripting
   - express (<=4.17.3): Parsing issues
   - socket.io (all): Regular expression DoS
   - web3 (all): Multiple vulnerabilities

2. **Implementation Plan**
   - Create a security-focused branch for testing upgrades
   - Prioritize fixes for components with direct user input exposure
   - Schedule security sprint after MVP stable release

The vulnerability information has been documented in detail in security-plan.md and will be addressed according to the timeline there.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Professional User Interface**:
   - Design language should communicate security and professionalism
   - Workflow should feel native to film industry professionals
   - Provide transparency and control over blockchain functionality without requiring detailed technical knowledge

2. **Data Security and Trust**:
   - IP protection is paramount for Hollywood content
   - Must offer both client-side and server-side protection
   - Interface should communicate security measures and give users control

3. **Content Workflow**:
   - Studio-grade content management
   - Secure metadata handling
   - Need robust tagging system for content discovery

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**CURRENT TASK**: Implementing Tag Management System

We've successfully implemented the frontend components for the tag management system:

1. Created Tag data models and interfaces
2. Built TagService for handling CRUD operations
3. Implemented TagManagementInterface for creating, editing, and organizing tags
4. Created TagSuggestionSystem for suggesting relevant tags for content
5. Built TagFilterInterface for filtering content by tags
6. Created TagManagementPage that combines all tag components in a tabbed interface
7. Added route for accessing the tag management page

The next steps are to:
1. Create API endpoints for tag operations
2. Connect the frontend components to the API
3. Implement tag-based search functionality
4. Add tags to existing content elements

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
We need to clarify how tags should be suggested for content. Current implementation uses mock data, but we'll need:
1. Rules for generating tag suggestions (AI-based, popularity, user history, etc.)
2. Approach for handling tag synonyms or similar concepts
3. Decision on auto-tagging vs. manual tagging workflows

Front-end tag components are now fully implemented but we need to know if any API endpoints for tag management already exist in the codebase or if we should create them from scratch.

## Lessons
1. Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
2. Read the file before trying to edit it.
3. If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
4. Always ask before using the -force git command.
5. When importing React components, ensure imports match export style (default vs. named).
