# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Search/Blockchain Crawler Integration**
   - Implement advanced filtering for movie Store
   - Create blockchain explorer for token ownership visibility
   - Ensure intuitive discovery experience for users
   - Test search performance with various content library sizes

2. **Enhance Pro User Experience**
   - Improve content management interface
   - Implement robust tagging system for better organization
   - Streamline movie tokenization process
   - Develop batch operations for efficient catalog management
   - Create detailed analytics dashboard for Pro users

3. **Storage and Content Delivery System**
   - Implement user-powered IPFS node network with incentives
   - Develop progressive decentralization strategy for content delivery
   - Create efficient content streaming solution for decentralized assets

## Key Challenges and Analysis
The Pro interface urgently needs enhancements as it's the primary touchpoint for content creators. A more intuitive and visually clear interface will help gain filmmaker trust. This is a critical step before focusing on the marketplace/consumer side.

Achieving platform parity is essential for providing a cohesive user experience across all parts of the platform. Currently, there are inconsistencies between the Pro interface and consumer-facing pages like Search and Store. We need to develop shared components that can be used across the platform to ensure visual and behavioral consistency.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
We've successfully enhanced platform parity by:

1. Creating shared components in the common directory:
   - ContentStatusBadge - A versatile status indicator that works across all contexts
   - EnhancedContentCard - A flexible content card with context-specific rendering

2. Refactoring existing implementation to use the shared components:
   - Updated SearchPage to use EnhancedContentCard for search results
   - Updated StorePage (formerly MarketplacePage) to use shared components
   - Created compatibility wrappers for Pro dashboard components
   - Modified ContentGrid to use the shared components

3. Rebranding from "Marketplace" to "Store":
   - Updated all references to maintain consistent terminology
   - Renamed components and files to reflect the new branding
   - Updated function names and UI text for consistency

These changes have significantly improved platform parity by ensuring consistent visual styling and behavior across different parts of the application. Users will now experience the same look and feel whether they're browsing the store, searching for content, or managing their own content in the Pro dashboard.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Rebrand references from "Marketplace" to "Store"
  - [x] Renamed API routes from `marketplaceRoutes.ts` to `storeRoutes.ts`
  - [x] Renamed API controllers from `marketplaceController.ts` to `storeController.ts`
  - [x] Renamed API services from `marketplaceService.ts` to `storeService.ts`
  - [x] Renamed client pages from `MarketplacePage.tsx` to `StorePage.tsx`
  - [x] Updated content service with proper method names
