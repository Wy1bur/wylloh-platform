# Wylloh Platform Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform aims to create a decentralized media licensing system utilizing blockchain technology, IPFS for content storage, and smart contracts for rights management. Based on the PRD and the current codebase, this plan outlines the steps needed to fully implement the platform according to specifications.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Need to ensure seamless integration between frontend, player, and smart contracts
   - Token verification must work consistently across platforms
   - Rights management needs implementation as specified in PRD

2. **Content Security**
   - End-to-end encryption needs implementation for content protection
   - Key management architecture should follow PRD specifications
   - Access control must be tightly integrated with blockchain verification

3. **Cross-Platform Experience**
   - Web-based player must work consistently across browsers
   - Seed One hardware integration requires optimization
   - Offline capabilities need implementation

4. **Smart Contract Implementation**
   - Current contracts (WyllohToken, WyllohMarketplace, RightsManager, RoyaltyDistributor) need verification against PRD
   - Testing and auditing required for security

5. **Scalability**
   - Content delivery via IPFS needs optimization
   - Backend services need scaling considerations

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

Currently debugging the token purchase flow in the demo environment. We've made several improvements:

1. **Contract Address Loading**: Changed from environment variables to loading from a deployedAddresses.json file to prevent timing issues in React.

2. **JSON Formatting Fix**: Corrected the JSON formatting in init-demo.sh which was causing parsing errors.

3. **Marketplace Pre-Approval**: Successfully implemented marketplace pre-approval using a Hardhat script. This should allow token purchases without the additional approval step.

4. **Ganache Balance**: Increased the starting ETH balance in Ganache from 1000 to 2000 ETH to ensure sufficient funds for all transactions.

### Demo Initialization Observations (Latest Run)

We executed `./stop-demo.sh && ./init-demo.sh` with the following observations:

- The script ran successfully and set up the demo environment.
- Contract addresses were properly generated:
  - Token contract: 0xe78A0F7E598Cc8b0Bb87894B0F60dD2a88d6a8Ab
  - Marketplace contract: 0x5b1869D9A4C187F2EAa108f3062412ecf0526b24
- The client config file was successfully created at `client/src/config/deployedAddresses.json`
- **Success**: Marketplace pre-approval was successful!
  - Using the first account (0x90F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1)
  - Approval transaction: 0x151a2642e7f47cbd12febb9a13e25bc7bf94625e133f4625bd45ff8c54e2e02a 
  - Gas used: 46266
- Both API server and client application started successfully.

Next steps are to:
1. Test the token purchase flow in the browser
2. Verify that the approval was correctly set and the purchase succeeds
3. Document any remaining issues or further improvements needed

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The demo initialization completed successfully with the marketplace pre-approval step finally working correctly. We switched from using the `cast send` command to using a more straightforward Hardhat script, which properly set the approval for the marketplace contract.

Now it's time to test the token purchase flow in the browser to verify our fixes. We should follow these steps:
1. Connect with the Creator wallet (0x90F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1)
2. Upload new content
3. Switch to Consumer wallet
4. Purchase the content
5. Observe the transaction flow in the browser console

## Lessons

- Include detailed information in program output for debugging purposes
- Always read files before attempting edits
- Run npm audit before proceeding when vulnerabilities appear in terminal
- Seek permission before using force options with git commands
- JSON formatting in shell scripts requires careful handling of backslashes for proper escaping
- Ensure sufficient ETH balance in test accounts for all transactions including deployment and approval costs
- Error messages in script output may be misleading - "Marketplace approval set" appeared despite the error
- When executing contract interactions in a Node.js context, use correct file extensions (.cjs vs .js) based on the project's module system
- Using Hardhat's ethers integration is more reliable than direct `cast` commands for contract interaction
