# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Search/Blockchain Crawler Integration**
   - Implement advanced filtering for movie Store
   - Create blockchain explorer for token ownership visibility
   - Ensure intuitive discovery experience for users
   - Test search performance with various content library sizes

2. **Enhance Pro User Experience**
   - Improve content management interface
   - Implement robust tagging system for better organization
   - Streamline movie tokenization process
   - Develop batch operations for efficient catalog management
   - Create detailed analytics dashboard for Pro users

3. **Storage and Content Delivery System**
   - Implement user-powered IPFS node network with incentives
   - Develop progressive decentralization strategy for content delivery
   - Create efficient content streaming solution for decentralized assets

## Key Challenges and Analysis
The Pro interface urgently needs enhancements as it's the primary touchpoint for content creators. A more intuitive and visually clear interface will help gain filmmaker trust. This is a critical step before focusing on the marketplace/consumer side.

Achieving platform parity is essential for providing a cohesive user experience across all parts of the platform. Currently, there are inconsistencies between the Pro interface and consumer-facing pages like Search and Store. We need to develop shared components that can be used across the platform to ensure visual and behavioral consistency.

The Pro Analytics Dashboard is a critical feature that will provide content creators with valuable insights into their content performance, audience engagement, and revenue streams. By implementing this feature, we will enhance the value proposition for content creators and help them make data-driven decisions about their content strategy.

A key challenge for our analytics approach is that as an inter-platform protocol, we don't have access to traditional user data. Instead, we need to focus on blockchain-specific metrics like wallet behavior patterns, token distribution, and transaction histories. This privacy-first approach aligns with blockchain principles while still providing valuable insights to content creators.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
We've made significant progress on implementing batch operations for content management in the library, with a focus on token collection handling:

1. Created ContentSelectionToolbar component that:
   - Supports selecting individual items or entire collections at once
   - Provides aggregate statistics for selected items (token counts, values)
   - Shows appropriate actions based on user type (Pro vs Standard)
   - Integrates with administrative approval workflows

2. Implemented a token collection detection system that:
   - Groups tokens by their underlying content/film
   - Shows aggregate information about token collections
   - Prevents UI clutter with large token collections
   - Supports both individual and batch operations

3. Started implementing a collection-based display approach with CollectionCard component that:
   - Shows a summary view of tokens from the same content
   - Provides expandable details to see individual tokens
   - Supports collection-level operations
   - Displays aggregate metrics (token count, total value)

This collection-aware approach addresses the concern about libraries with large quantities of tokens for the same film title (like "Transformers"), making the library interface clean and manageable even for users with thousands of tokens.

We're still working on the integration of these components with the LibraryPage. The next steps are to:

1. Complete the LibraryPage update to use ContentSelectionToolbar and CollectionCard
2. Implement BatchActionModals component for collection-aware batch operations
3. Add background task progress tracking for operations that may take time (bulk transfers, etc.)

We're also ensuring that all components respect the admin approval workflows for Pro users and content tokenization, by checking appropriate status flags and displaying pending approval states where relevant.

## Lessons
1. Maintain consistent naming conventions across the platform
2. Create components with context-awareness to adapt to different parts of the application
3. Use dedicated wrapper components for backward compatibility when refactoring
4. Keep component props consistent across similar components for easier integration 
5. Leverage existing libraries like Recharts for data visualization rather than building from scratch
6. Focus on blockchain-specific metrics rather than traditional user data for analytics
7. Respect privacy while still providing valuable insights through pattern analysis 
8. Create type extensions for missing properties when working with existing interfaces
9. Use type assertions carefully when dealing with extended interfaces
10. Design UIs with collection-based views for managing large token sets efficiently

## Enhanced Token Collection Management Plan

### Background and Challenge
A significant challenge we need to address is efficiently handling large collections of tokens in the Library interface. Users (both Pro and Standard) may own multiple tokens for the same film or content item (e.g., 1000 tokens for "Transformers"). The current LibraryPage implementation displays each token individually, which would create a cluttered and unmanageable interface.

### Approach to Token Collection Management
We will implement a collection-based display approach in the library that:

1. Groups tokens by their underlying content (film/title)
2. Shows aggregate information (total quantity, value) for each collection
3. Provides batch operations for token management
4. Integrates with existing admin approval workflows

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Content Collection Model Enhancements
- Extend the LibraryItem interface to support token collections
- Add collection metadata including:
  - Total token quantity for the same content
  - Reference to master content item
  - Collection status (complete/partial)
  - Collection-level permissions

#### 2. Collection-based UI
- Create CollectionCard component that shows:
  - Film/content details (title, thumbnail, etc.)
  - Token quantity badge (e.g., "x250 tokens")
  - Aggregated value information
  - Rights threshold indicators
- Implement expandable view to see individual tokens when needed
- Add collection filtering and sorting options

#### 3. Collection-Aware Batch Operations
The batch operations we're implementing will be collection-aware, enabling:
- Selection of entire collections or individual tokens
- Batch operations across collection boundaries
- Collection-level operations (lend/sell entire collection)
- Token grouping operations (create subcollections)

#### 4. Admin Integration
We will ensure our implementations work seamlessly with:
- Pro user approval workflow in UsersPage
- Content tokenization approval in ContentModerationPage
- Maintain approval history tracking for tokens and collections

### Key Components to Implement

1. **ContentCollectionCard**
   - Displays collection information rather than individual tokens
   - Shows collection metrics (token count, total value, etc.)
   - Provides collection-level actions

2. **ContentSelectionToolbar** (with collection enhancements)
   - Allows selection of collections and individual tokens
   - Supports filtering and grouping by collection
   - Shows aggregated information for selected items

3. **CollectionManagementInterface**
   - Provides tools to create, modify, and manage collections
   - Supports splitting and merging collections
   - Handles token transfers between collections

4. **BatchActionModals** (collection-aware)
   - Supports operations on collections and individual tokens
   - Provides collection-level confirmation dialogs
   - Shows impact of operations on collection integrity

## ContentSelectionToolbar Implementation Plan

### Overview
The ContentSelectionToolbar will be our first component in implementing batch operations, with special consideration for token collections. This component will enable users to select multiple content items or entire collections for batch actions.

### Component Requirements
1. **Collection-aware selection**
   - Select individual items
   - Select entire collections
   - Select all items matching criteria

2. **Selection feedback**
   - Clear indication of selected items
   - Count of selected items/collections
   - Aggregate data for selection (total value, etc.)

3. **Action availability**
   - Context-specific action buttons
   - Support for Pro vs Standard user distinctions
   - Integration with admin approval status

4. **Performance considerations**
   - Efficient handling of large collections
   - Lazy loading for expanded collection views
   - Optimized rendering for large libraries

### Implementation Approach

1. Create a new component in `client/src/components/library/ContentSelectionToolbar.tsx`
2. Implement selection state management
3. Create collection-aware selection logic
4. Build the toolbar UI with action buttons
5. Implement integration with parent components

### Detailed Tasks

1. **Selection State Management**
   - Implement selection tracking by ID
   - Create special handling for collection selection
   - Track partial collection selections
   - Support inversion of selection

2. **Toolbar UI**
   - Design clean, accessible toolbar interface
   - Show selection count and aggregate metrics
   - Provide contextual action buttons
   - Include selection helpers (select all, none, invert)

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Use memo and callback optimizations
   - Create efficient collection expansion handling

4. **Action Button Integration**
   - Connect to batch action handlers
   - Support multiple action types (lend, sell, organize)
   - Implement permission checks based on user type and token status

### Integration with Admin Workflows
The ContentSelectionToolbar will respect admin approval status:
- Only approved Pro users can access certain batch features
- Only approved content can be tokenized
- Pending approvals will be clearly indicated
- Admin decisions will be reflected immediately in the UI

This comprehensive approach ensures that our library interface will remain clean and manageable even for users with large token collections, while maintaining support for powerful batch operations and respecting the admin approval workflows.

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

3. **Content Privacy and Access Control**: IPFS is public by default:
   - Implement robust encryption for private content
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Design access control mechanisms that work with IPFS's public nature

4. **Integration with Filecoin**: For long-term archival storage:
   - Complete the integration with Filecoin for archival
   - Implement proper deal management

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

We need to determine how to set up an IPFS node cluster for production use. Key questions include:
1. How many nodes should we deploy in the cluster?
2. What is the appropriate geographic distribution for nodes to ensure global access?
3. What hardware specifications are required for production nodes?
4. Should we use a managed service or self-host the node cluster?

## Lessons

- IPFS is content-addressed, meaning the same content always produces the same address (CID)
- Proper pinning is essential for ensuring content persistence in IPFS
- Encryption is necessary since IPFS content is publicly accessible by default
- Gateway selection impacts user experience dramatically - need a good selection strategy
- Chunked uploads are essential for handling large media files in IPFS
- Using multiple pinning services provides redundancy for content availability

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

3. **Content Privacy and Access Control**: IPFS is public by default:
   - Implement robust encryption for private content
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Design access control mechanisms that work with IPFS's public nature

4. **Integration with Filecoin**: For long-term archival storage:
   - Complete the integration with Filecoin for archival
   - Implement proper deal management
   - Handle retrieval workflows efficiently

5. **Browser-based Node Challenges**: The client-side IPFS node:
   - Manage resource usage (bandwidth, memory, CPU)
   - Handle browser limitations and security restrictions
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

We need to determine how to set up an IPFS node cluster for production use. Key questions include:
1. How many nodes should we deploy in the cluster?
2. What is the appropriate geographic distribution for nodes to ensure global access?
3. What hardware specifications are required for production nodes?
4. Should we use a managed service or self-host the node cluster?

## Lessons

- IPFS is content-addressed, meaning the same content always produces the same address (CID)
- Proper pinning is essential for ensuring content persistence in IPFS
- Encryption is necessary since IPFS content is publicly accessible by default
- Gateway selection impacts user experience dramatically - need a good selection strategy
- Chunked uploads are essential for handling large media files in IPFS
- Using multiple pinning services provides redundancy for content availability

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

3. **Content Privacy and Access Control**: IPFS is public by default:
   - Implement robust encryption for private content
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Design access control mechanisms that work with IPFS's public nature

4. **Integration with Filecoin**: For long-term archival storage:
   - Complete the integration with Filecoin for archival
   - Implement proper deal management
   - Handle retrieval workflows efficiently

5. **Browser-based Node Challenges**: The client-side IPFS node:
   - Manage resource usage (bandwidth, memory, CPU)
   - Handle browser limitations and security restrictions
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

We need to determine how to set up an IPFS node cluster for production use. Key questions include:
1. How many nodes should we deploy in the cluster?
2. What is the appropriate geographic distribution for nodes to ensure global access?
3. What hardware specifications are required for production nodes?
4. Should we use a managed service or self-host the node cluster?

## Lessons

- IPFS is content-addressed, meaning the same content always produces the same address (CID)
- Proper pinning is essential for ensuring content persistence in IPFS
- Encryption is necessary since IPFS content is publicly accessible by default
- Gateway selection impacts user experience dramatically - need a good selection strategy
- Chunked uploads are essential for handling large media files in IPFS
- Using multiple pinning services provides redundancy for content availability

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

3. **Content Privacy and Access Control**: IPFS is public by default:
   - Implement robust encryption for private content
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Design access control mechanisms that work with IPFS's public nature

4. **Integration with Filecoin**: For long-term archival storage:
   - Complete the integration with Filecoin for archival
   - Implement proper deal management
   - Handle retrieval workflows efficiently

5. **Browser-based Node Challenges**: The client-side IPFS node:
   - Manage resource usage (bandwidth, memory, CPU)
   - Handle browser limitations and security restrictions
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## High-level Task Breakdown

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

We need to determine how to set up an IPFS node cluster for production use. Key questions include:
1. How many nodes should we deploy in the cluster?
2. What is the appropriate geographic distribution for nodes to ensure global access?
3. What hardware specifications are required for production nodes?
4. Should we use a managed service or self-host the node cluster?

## Lessons

- Proper pinning is essential for ensuring content persistence in IPFS
- Encryption is necessary since IPFS content is publicly accessible by default
- Gateway selection impacts user experience dramatically - need a good selection strategy
- Chunked uploads are essential for handling large media files in IPFS
- Using multiple pinning services provides redundancy for content availability

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

- Proper pinning is essential for ensuring content persistence in IPFS
- Encryption is necessary since IPFS content is publicly accessible by default
- Gateway selection impacts user experience dramatically - need a good selection strategy
- Chunked uploads are essential for handling large media files in IPFS
- Using multiple pinning services provides redundancy for content availability

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

3. **Content Privacy and Access Control**: IPFS is public by default:
   - Implement robust encryption for private content
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Design access control mechanisms that work with IPFS's public nature

4. **Integration with Filecoin**: For long-term archival storage:
   - Complete the integration with Filecoin for archival
   - Implement proper deal management
   - Handle retrieval workflows efficiently

5. **Browser-based Node Challenges**: The client-side IPFS node:
   - Manage resource usage (bandwidth, memory, CPU)
   - Handle browser limitations and security restrictions
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

We need to determine how to set up an IPFS node cluster for production use. Key questions include:
1. How many nodes should we deploy in the cluster?
2. What is the appropriate geographic distribution for nodes to ensure global access?
3. What hardware specifications are required for production nodes?
4. Should we use a managed service or self-host the node cluster?

## Lessons

- IPFS is content-addressed, meaning the same content always produces the same address (CID)
- Proper pinning is essential for ensuring content persistence in IPFS
- Encryption is necessary since IPFS content is publicly accessible by default
- Gateway selection impacts user experience dramatically - need a good selection strategy
- Chunked uploads are essential for handling large media files in IPFS
- Using multiple pinning services provides redundancy for content availability

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

3. **Content Privacy and Access Control**: IPFS is public by default:
   - Implement robust encryption for private content
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Design access control mechanisms that work with IPFS's public nature

4. **Integration with Filecoin**: For long-term archival storage:
   - Complete the integration with Filecoin for archival
   - Implement proper deal management
   - Handle retrieval workflows efficiently

5. **Browser-based Node Challenges**: The client-side IPFS node:
   - Manage resource usage (bandwidth, memory, CPU)
   - Handle browser limitations and security restrictions
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

We need to determine how to set up an IPFS node cluster for production use. Key questions include:
1. How many nodes should we deploy in the cluster?
2. What is the appropriate geographic distribution for nodes to ensure global access?
3. What hardware specifications are required for production nodes?
4. Should we use a managed service or self-host the node cluster?

## Lessons

- IPFS is content-addressed, meaning the same content always produces the same address (CID)
- Proper pinning is essential for ensuring content persistence in IPFS
- Encryption is necessary since IPFS content is publicly accessible by default
- Gateway selection impacts user experience dramatically - need a good selection strategy
- Chunked uploads are essential for handling large media files in IPFS
- Using multiple pinning services provides redundancy for content availability

# Wylloh Platform IPFS Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Wylloh platform requires a decentralized content storage solution to ensure content ownership, permanence, and censorship resistance. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides a suitable foundation for this requirement by enabling content-addressed storage rather than location-addressed storage. By integrating IPFS, Wylloh can provide users with true ownership of their content while maintaining compatibility with web3 principles.

The platform already has placeholder code for IPFS integration in the `storage` module, but it requires enhancement and robust implementation to handle production workloads, ensure content persistence through pinning, manage encryption for private content, and provide reliable access through gateway management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Content Persistence**: IPFS doesn't guarantee content persistence without pinning. We need to implement:
   - Robust pinning service integration (Pinata, Infura, or self-hosted cluster)
   - Backup mechanisms to ensure content doesn't disappear
   - Monitoring system for content availability

2. **Performance and User Experience**: IPFS can be slower than traditional centralized storage:
   - Need CDN-like gateway solutions for faster content delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Consider hybrid approaches for popular content

3. **Content Privacy and Access Control**: IPFS is public by default:
   - Implement robust encryption for private content
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Design access control mechanisms that work with IPFS's public nature

4. **Integration with Filecoin**: For long-term archival storage:
   - Complete the integration with Filecoin for archival
   - Implement proper deal management
   - Handle retrieval workflows efficiently

5. **Browser-based Node Challenges**: The client-side IPFS node:
   - Manage resource usage (bandwidth, memory, CPU)
   - Handle browser limitations and security restrictions
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility
