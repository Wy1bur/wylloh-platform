# Wylloh Platform: North Star Guide

## Vision

Wylloh is a blockchain-based media licensing system that revolutionizes how digital content is distributed, accessed, and monetized. We create a transparent, efficient, and equitable ecosystem where creators maintain control of their intellectual property while audiences gain flexible access to content through tokenized ownership.

## Core Value Proposition

- **For Creators**: Perpetual royalties on all sales, granular control over licensing terms, automated rights management
- **For Consumers**: True ownership of purchased content, ability to resell licenses, flexible consumption options
- **For Exhibitors**: Frictionless licensing, automated royalty distribution, reduced legal overhead
- **For Streaming Services**: API-driven content acquisition, efficient rights management

## Key Product Pillars

1. **Modular Rights Management**: 
   - License tokens can be stacked to unlock different usage rights
   - Quantity-based thresholds for commercial vs. personal use

2. **Blockchain-Secured Content**: 
   - End-to-end encryption for IPFS-stored media
   - Key management tied to token ownership
   - Wallet-based authentication and verification

3. **Decentralized Distribution**:
   - Content not locked to specific platforms
   - Licenses persist independent of service providers
   - Direct creator-to-audience relationship

4. **User-Focused Experience**:
   - Intuitive interfaces masking blockchain complexity
   - Seamless content purchasing and playback
   - Multiple viewing options across devices

## Primary User Flows

1. **Creator Journey**:
   - Upload and encrypt content
   - Define license tiers and rights thresholds
   - Tokenize and publish to marketplace
   - Receive perpetual royalties

2. **Consumer Journey**:
   - Discover content in marketplace
   - Purchase license tokens
   - Access content across platforms
   - Potentially resell licenses

## Technical Foundations

1. **Content Security**:
   - AES-256 encryption for all media
   - Keys accessible only to token owners
   - Blockchain verification for playback authorization

2. **Storage Architecture**:
   - IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized content storage
   - Multi-gateway support for reliable access
   - Local caching for performance optimization

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Polygon for scalable, low-cost transactions
   - Smart contracts for license verification
   - Wallet connection for authentication

4. **Player Components**:
   - Cross-platform playback support
   - Integrated license verification
   - Support for streaming and download options

## Success Metrics

1. **Platform Growth**:
   - Number of creators onboarded
   - Content volume available
   - Transaction volume

2. **User Satisfaction**:
   - Content access reliability
   - Playback experience quality
   - Purchase process simplicity

3. **Technical Performance**:
   - Content access speed and reliability
   - Transaction success rate
   - System uptime and responsiveness

## Development Principles

1. **Security First**: All development prioritizes content protection and secure ownership
2. **User Experience**: Technical complexity must be hidden from end users
3. **Modularity**: Components should be designed for reusability and extensibility
4. **Progressive Decentralization**: Balance between Web3 ideals and practical user experience
5. **Performance Optimization**: Content access should be fast and reliable despite decentralization
