## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to the Wylloh platform, please follow these security best practices:

### Environment Variables

- Never commit sensitive information such as API keys, private keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Reference the `.env.example` files for required variables

### Smart Contract Development

- Follow established smart contract security patterns
- Use OpenZeppelin's security audited contracts where possible
- Be aware of common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, etc.)
- Write comprehensive tests for all contract functionality

### API Security

- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Frontend Security

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Be cautious with third-party libraries

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Minimize the use of unnecessary dependencies

## Bug Bounty Program

We are currently working on establishing a bug bounty program. Details will be announced in the future.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as part of our regular release cycle unless a critical vulnerability requires an immediate patch.
